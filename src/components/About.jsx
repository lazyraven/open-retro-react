          If you’ve got the fun, exciting, and innovative team - we have the
          tool. EasyRetro is a fun retrospective (‘retro’ for short) tool you
          can use for your regular sprint session to discuss what went well and
          what didn’t. You’ll be able to easily identify obstacles and discuss
          ideas for improvements that will allow you to move forward unhindered.

          It’s also a great opportunity for everyone to see and understand the
          workflow and collaborations while addressing issues with this.

          Your outcome? A list of points and notes the team can action, improve

          attended to.
