          If you’ve got the fun, exciting, and innovative team - we have the
          tool. OpenRetro is a fun retrospective ('retro' for short) tool you
          can use for your regular sprint session to discuss what went well and
          what didn’t. You’ll be able to easily identify obstacles and discuss
          ideas for improvements that will allow you to move forward unhindered.
